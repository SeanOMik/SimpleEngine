## SimpleEngine
SimpleEngine is a 3D and 2D game engine written in modern C++20. Its main focus is simplicity of all systems.

## State
The `feature/3d-opengl` branch is not usable **AT ALL**, doesn't even have a coordinate system yet. The `master` branch is 2D only but still isn't in a state to make a game. This project is more of something for me to mess around with to learn new C++20 concepts.
