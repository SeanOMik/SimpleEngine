## SimpleEngine
SimpleEngine is a 2D game engine written in C++20. Its main focus is simplicity of all systems.

## State
This game engine is not near being ready for an actual game. Its more of something for me to mess around with to learn new C++ concepts.

## Dependencies
* [SFML2](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

## Install
Should be simple, just install SFML2 from somewhere and make sure that CMake can find it. For windows I used vcpkg, you can use whatever.
